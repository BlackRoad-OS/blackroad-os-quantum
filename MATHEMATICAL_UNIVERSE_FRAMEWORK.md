## 1️⃣ NUMBER THEORY & QUANTUM

### Ramanujan's Infinite Series
```
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + ... = -1/12  (ζ-function regularization)

Connection to Quantum:
- Casimir effect uses ζ(-1) = -1/12
- Vacuum energy in quantum field theory
- String theory vibration modes
```

### Zeckendorf Representation (Fibonacci)
```
Every positive integer = sum of non-consecutive Fibonacci numbers

F(n) = φⁿ/√5 - ψⁿ/√5  (Binet's formula)
Where: φ = (1+√5)/2 (golden ratio)
       ψ = (1-√5)/2

Quantum Connection:
- φ appears in qudit dimensions (our Fibonacci qudits!)
- ψ is the complex conjugate
- Non-consecutive = anti-commutation relations
```

### Riemann Hypothesis
```
ζ(s) = Σ 1/nˢ  (for Re(s) > 1)

All non-trivial zeros have Re(s) = 1/2

Hilbert-Pólya Conjecture:
  The zeros are eigenvalues of a Hermitian operator!

Nyman-Beurling Criterion:
  RH ⟺ certain function space is dense

Li's Criterion:
  RH ⟺ λₙ ≥ 0 for all n

De Bruijn-Newman Constant:
  Λ ≤ 1/2 (proved 2018)
  If Λ = 0 → RH is true!

QUANTUM CONNECTION:
- Hermitian operators → Observable in quantum mechanics
- Energy levels of quantum chaotic systems

  Both form closed algebras
```

**SU(2) Group (Quantum Rotations):**
